Forms for Model, BOP, SED, Prediction, and SSR entries include a field for tags, or keywords. This field takes a list of comma-separated keywords. These tags can be used to find related entries. The tags are used to generate a tag cloud displayed in the sidebar. Each tag cloud contains all of the tags associated with entries of that type (Model, BOP, SED, Prediction or SSR). The relative size of each tag is determined by the number of entries it is associated with (the exact number is shown in parentheses).
