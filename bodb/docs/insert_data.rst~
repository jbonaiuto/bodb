Brief Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Start with an edited abstract of the key paper, but update it to summarize key points as you write the Narrative.

Narrative
^^^^^^^^^
The Narrative reviews "how the model works" and "what the model does". It will thus refer to the diagrams associated with the model and the linked SEDs and SSRs. Part of your success as collator here in connecting SEDs and SSRs to the model is to be judicious in what you highlight and what you omit. The BODB entry is not meant to replace the article(s) which document the Model but rather to help the user assess the Model in relation to available empirical data` and modeling goals. Insert citations of references in (Author, Year) style here (and in SEDs below) with formal bibliographic entries below. You should ensure that the reference is included in the Literature section of BODB, perhaps as a result of using the PubMed Tool.

    The expanded Architecture section
    
*Diagrams*

Since the model may be hierarchical, you may choose to use several diagrams. Use at least one to present the overall structure of the Model. In some cases, a diagram will explicitly show not only the immediate submodules but also the further decomposition of some of these. In other cases, you will need a separate diagram to show how a module shown as a unit of an earlier diagram is expanded to reveal the structure of its submodules.

In order to add a diagram, click on the "Add new" link in the Diagrams section. This will open the Add Diagram window. Clicking on the "Edit" link next to a diagram already linked to the model will open the Edit Diagram window, and clicking on the "Delete" link will delete the diagram and remove it from the Model.

*Inputs*

The Name, DataType (i.e. Image, Vector, Scalar) and Description of all inputs to the model.

*Outputs*

The Name, DataType (i.e. Image, Vector, Scalar) and Description of all outputs of the model.

*States*

The Name, DataType (i.e. Image, Vector, Scalar) and Description of all states of the model. In general, the state of a module comprises the state of all the submodules which comprise it. It is thus a matter of judgment by the collator whether the state of a module whose decomposition is presented should be described or left implicit.

*Submodules*

New submodules can be added by clicking on the "Add new" link in the Submodules section. This will add a new form containing fields for the Name and Description of the submodule. Clicking on the "Expand" link next to the new submodule form will make visible the Narrative field. To delete the submodule and remove it from the model click on the "Delete" link.

*SEDs Used to Build the Model*

When reading about a Model, you may find that some of the empirical data that are cited are not actually used either in defining or testing the model. In most cases, you will not document such data in BODB. But in some cases, you may decide that they strengthen the Model Entry by setting the scene for the actual modeling. Alternately, SEDs may support some aspect of model design, e.g., an SED showing an inhibitory connection between 2 brain regions would support the decision to constrain the connection between Model modules representing those brain regions to be inhibitory.

In order to add an existing SED to the current Model, clicking on the "Search" link in the SEDs Used to Build the Model section will open the SED Search window. Clicking "Select" next to one of the search results will add that SED to the SED section. In order to add a new SED and link it to the current BOP entry, click on the "Add new" link will to add a new SED and automatically add it to the SED section.

A specific summary datum may be classified as pertaining to the present Model in 2 different ways. 

#. Scene setting - Background information that is not specifically used in developing or assessing the principle. 
#. Support - These are data that are examples of the principle.

After the user links an existing SED, she should specify the relation between the present BOP entry and the SED as one of "Scene Setting" or "Support" and add a "Relevance Narrative". This will aid in clarifying how the summary data relate to the Model.

*SEDs Used to Test the Model*

SEDs used to test the model's performance can be linked to Summaries of Simulation Results (SSRs) that either explain or contradict them. 

In order to add an existing SED to the current Model, clicking on the "Search" link in the SEDs Used to Test the Model section will open the SED Search window. Clicking "Select" next to one of the search results will add that SED to the SED section. In order to add a new SED and link it to the current BOP entry, click on the "Add new" link will to add a new SED and automatically add it to the SED section.

A specific summary datum may be classified as pertaining to the present Model in 2 different ways. 

#. Explaination - The experimental data is explained by the model.
#. Contradition - The experimental data is contradicted by the model.

After the user links an existing SED, she should specify the relation between the present Model entry and the SED as one of "Explaination" or "Contradiction" and add a "Relevance Narrative". This will aid in clarifying how the summary data relate to the Model.

The user can also add an SSR by entering a Title and a description of the SSR. Note that an SSR is always linked to either and SED or a Prediction (see below).

*Predictions*

Predictions made by the model can be entered and optionally linked to Summaries of Simulation Results (SSRs). Clicking on the "Add new" link will insert a new row in the Predictions section with fields for the Name and Description. SSRs can be added to the prediction by entering the title and a description.

Insert SED
----------

BODB allows the user to insert a Summary of Experimental Data (SED) in addition to BOP and Model entries. The summary could be any facts, hypotheses or experimental settings and results in a particular domain from one or several publications. The current version of allows four types of SEDs:

* Generic Summary of Experimental Data
* Summary of Brain Imaging Data
* Summary of Event Related Potential Data
* Summary of Connectity Data

.. figure:: images/sed_types.png
    :align: center
    :figclass: align-center

    SED types

To enter an SED of a particular type, click on the corresponding link to populate a form. The form for each type has a set of unique fields along with a set of fields that are the same for all SEDs (Figures, Related BOPs, Related Brain Regions, and References). First we will detail the unique fields for each type and then we will detail the fields that all SEDs have. 

Generic SED

Summary of Brain Imaging Summary Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
BODB is intended to serve also as an experimental-data repository. In addition to the generic SED entry form, it provides an explicit storage and user interface for tables of brain imaging data based on Talairach coordinates. Although brain imaging data are often supplied in table format, different articles may differ in the number, labeling and layout of columns, and differ in the freeform description of the experimental conditions of that table. Moreover, article data files are in various formats such as PDF, HTML and Microsoft Word. Therefore, it is difficult to provide a tool that automatically reads the data file, excerpts the whole table and its description, then marshals and puts these data into BODB properly. Our solution for importing the table is to provide a structured input form for pasting the table’s description and data, and specifying metadata (column configuration). The structure of the input form and the metadata will assist the user populate the table data correctly.
