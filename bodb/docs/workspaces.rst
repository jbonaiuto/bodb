Workspaces
==============

In BODB, we have introduced the idea of Collaborative Workspaces (CoWos) to fascilitate collaboration and sharing of ideas. The workspace page allows a user to view and create any number of workspaces.

Coordinates
^^^^^^^^^^^

The Coordinates tab allows users to save and load sets of coordinates from brain imaging SEDs. Any time the user clicks on a checkbox next to a coordinate in a Brain Imaging SED search result it is added to the currently active coordinate set. The Active Coordinate Set section lists the name and description of the currently active set along with a list of all coordinates in the set, grouped by the SED that they belong to. The Saved Coordinate Sets section lists all of the coordinate sets saved in this workspace. Users can click Load next to a set to make it active, or Delete to delete it. Clicking on the New button will clear the currently active coordinate set so that a new one can be created.
