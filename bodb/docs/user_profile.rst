Subscriptions
-------------

BODB allows users to set up subscriptions to be automatically notified when new entries with certain keywords are added to the system. To add a new subscription, click the "Add new" link in the Subscriptions section. This will add a new subscription row. The Entry Type can be Model, BOP, SED, Prediction, or SSR, and the Keywords field takes a list of keywords separated by spaces. If these keywords appear anywhere in a new entry of the specified type, a notification will be sent to the user using their preferred method.
