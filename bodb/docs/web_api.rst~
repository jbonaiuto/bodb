Web API
==============

URL Protocol
------------

The BODB web API allows entries and sets of entries to be returned in JSON and XML format through a simple URL protocol.

* bodb.usc.edu/bodb/api/
    * document/
        * bop/
        * model/
        * sed/
            * erp_sed/
            * brain_imaging_sed/
            * connectivity_sed/
        * ssr/
        * prediction/
* brain_region/


Using the API in a Browser
--------------------------

By entering one of the possible url given above into a browser, you will get a human readible view of the first 20 entries of a given type.

.. figure:: images/model_api.png
    :align: center
    :figclass: align-center

    Using the API in a browser
    
Then you can append the primary key with a trailing slash to show an individual entry.

.. figure:: images/fars_api.png
    :align: center
    :figclass: align-center

URL Extensions and Using the API Programatically 
------------------------------------------------

By default, the API returns an html document for readability in a browser. When working programatically, it is best to strickly return JSON or XML. This can simply be done by adding the extention '.json' or '.xml' to the URL.

.. code-block:: json

    curl http://bodb.usc.edu/bodb/api/document/bop/617/.json
    
    {"id": 617, "title": "Population coding", "collator": {"id": 19, "username": "jbonaiuto"}, "last_modified_by": {"id": 489, "username": "mwinter80"}, "last_modified_time": "2014-04-24T18:25:07Z", "parent": {"id": 821, "title": "Incremental grouping", "brief_description": "Incremental grouping is a flexible mechanism for perceptual grouping, labeling  a  population  of  neurons  that  encode  features  to  be  grouped  perceptually  by  adjusting  their  firing  rates, using   recurrent  processing  to  fine  linkages for such tasks as  object  recognition  or  path  finding."}, "brief_description": "Information encoding scheme widely used in the brain where information is represented in the activities of whole populations of units.

Pagination
----------

When calling the API on several entries (that is, without appending a primary key at the end), only twenty entries are returned by default. This can be changed by appending '?page_size=xxx' where 'xxx' is the number of entries to be returned.

For example:

.. code-block:: json

    http://bodb.usc.edu/bodb/api/document/sed/.json?page_size=30
