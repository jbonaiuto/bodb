Messages
==============

The BODB messaging system allows users to send and receive message to and from other users. In the top right corner where the currently logged in user is displayed is a mail icon that links to the messages page. When the currently logged in user has unread messages, the mail icon will include a red number notifying the user of the unread messages.

Viewing Messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Inbox tab of the Messages page lists all messages - read and unread. For each message, the sender is displayed as well as the subject, a portion of the text, and the date and time it was received. After selecting messages by clicking on their checkbox, the user can delete, mark them as read, or mark them as unread by clicking on the appropriate button.
