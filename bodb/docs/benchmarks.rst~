Benchmarks
==============

BODB allows users to compare SEDs and Models using a benchmarking tool. This view shows how a set of Models explain, support, or set a set of SEDS

In any list view for SEDs or Models (such as from a search or entries added to a Workspace), will include a "Model Benchmark" or "Benchmark" button that will generate the comparison.

Benchmarking Models
-------------------

When benchmarking across a set of Models, all the SEDs that are related (explanation, support, scene setting) to the Models are gathered for the comparison
