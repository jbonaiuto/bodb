                    The Brain Operation Database (BODB) is part of the University of Southern California Brain Project
                    (USCBP) and has been designed and implemented by many people under the leadership of Michael A. Arbib.
                    Mihail Bota designed the related NeuroHomology Database (NHDB). Salvador Marmol designed ARDB (the
                    Action Recognition Database), the precursor of BODB, and Rishabh Tandon updated it and released ARDB
                    version 2.0. The name BODB was chosen to replace ARDB to better indicate the wide applicability of the
                    systemâ€™s functionalities. We also appreciate the generosity of Peter Fox and Jack Lancaster from the
                    Research Imaging Center, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, for making
                    available the brain templates and database of regional Talairach coordinates from their Talairach Demon
                    which was developed  as part of <a href="http://brainmap.org/">BrainMap</a> an online database of
                    published functional neuroimaging experiments with coordinate-based (Talairach) activation locations.
                    Anon Plangprasopchok took the lead in implementing version 2.0 of BODB while Nantana Tinroongroj
                    developed the first version of the Talairach Demon now integrated with BODB. Implementation of version
                    3.0 of BODB was primarily the work of James Bonaiuto.
