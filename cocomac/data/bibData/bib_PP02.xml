<Quotation>[p. 301] spread slightly into the posterior bank of the arcuate sulcus. Labelledneurons were noted in area 9/46v and in area 46 further rostrally inboth the supragranular and infragranular layers. Ventrally, labelledneurons could be seen in area 47/12, extending into its orbital part. Inthe orbitofrontal cortex, a few labelled neurons were seen in areas 10,11, 47/12 and 13, involving supragranular and infragranular layers.Distinct clusters of neurons were also noted in the dorsolateral frontalcortex, in areas 8Ad, 8B, the dorsomedial part of rostral area 6, area 9and area 46, both in the supragranular and infragranular layers. Onthe medial surface of the brain (Fig. 10B), scattered neurons werenoted in area 6, area 8B, area 9 and area 10. Labelled neurons werealso noted in area 24 of the cingulate gyrus. A distinct cluster ofneurons occurred in the lower bank and depth (24c) and the upperbank of the cingulate sulcus, corresponding to the cingulate motorareas. Labelled neurons were also observed in ventral area 6 andarea ProM, the peri-central operculum (SII), as well as in the insula.In part, these somatosensory connections may have been due to thelimited spreading of the injection to the posterior bank of the arcuatesulcus, i.e. in area 44. However, many of these connections werereplicated in Case 2 in which there was no involvement of theposterior bank of the arcuate sulcus. It should be noted here thatconnections between the ventral premotor cortex and the ventralprearcuate region were also previously noted (Godschalk et al., 1984;Barbas &amp; Pandya, 1987). The connection between the ventralprearcuate region and the posterior insula was also observed byMesulam &amp; Mufson (1982).In the parietal lobe, neurons were observed in area PG and adjacentarea POa in the lower bank of the intraparietal sulcus. Projection tothe part of the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex that is de∆ned as area 45in the present architectonic investigation was previously noted instudies that examined injections of anterograde tracers in the inferiorparietal lobule and the adjacent lateral intraparietal sulcus (Petrides &amp;Pandya, 1984; Cavada &amp; Goldman-Rakic, 1989).A substantial number of neurons was observed in the supratemporalplane and the superior temporal gyrus. In the supratemporalplane, neurons were mainly located in the cortex of the circularsulcus, involving areas PaI and ProK, whereas in the superior temporal gyrus distinct clusters of neurons occurred in areas TS1,TS2, TS3, paAlt and Tpt. A large number of labelled neurons wereobserved in areas TAa, TPO and PGa on the upper bank of thesuperior temporal sulcus. On the lower bank of this sulcus, scatteredneurons were seen in areas TEa and FST. These inputs are consistentwith the results of investigations that examined the projections frominjections of anterograde tracers into the superior temporal gyrus(Petrides &amp; Pandya, 1988; Romanski et al., 1999) and the upper bankof the superior temporal sulcus (Seltzer &amp; Pandya, 1989). Thesestudies demonstrated terminations to the ventrolateral region herede∆ned as area 45, although these connections were not described asterminating in area 45 but rather in a part of area 12.</Quotation>

The connection between the ventralprearcuate region and the posterior insula was also observed byMesulam &amp; Mufson (1982).In the parietal lobe, neurons were observed in area PG and adjacentarea POa in the lower bank of the intraparietal sulcus. Projection tothe part of the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex that is de∆ned as area 45in the present architectonic investigation was previously noted instudies that examined injections of anterograde tracers in the inferiorparietal lobule and the adjacent lateral intraparietal sulcus (Petrides &amp;Pandya, 1984; Cavada &amp; Goldman-Rakic, 1989).A substantial number of neurons was observed in the supratemporalplane and the superior temporal gyrus. In the supratemporalplane, neurons were mainly located in the cortex of the circularsulcus, involving areas PaI and ProK, whereas in the superior temporal gyrus distinct clusters of neurons occurred in areas TS1,TS2, TS3, paAlt and Tpt. A large number of labelled neurons wereobserved in areas TAa, TPO and PGa on the upper bank of thesuperior temporal sulcus. On the lower bank of this sulcus, scatteredneurons were seen in areas TEa and FST. These inputs are consistentwith the results of investigations that examined the projections frominjections of anterograde tracers into the superior temporal gyrus(Petrides &amp; Pandya, 1988; Romanski et al., 1999) and the upper bankof the superior temporal sulcus (Seltzer &amp; Pandya, 1989). Thesestudies demonstrated terminations to the ventrolateral region herede∆ned as area 45, although these connections were not described asterminating in area 45 but rather in a part of area 12.</Quotation>

Projection tothe part of the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex that is de∆ned as area 45in the present architectonic investigation was previously noted instudies that examined injections of anterograde tracers in the inferiorparietal lobule and the adjacent lateral intraparietal sulcus (Petrides &amp;Pandya, 1984; Cavada &amp; Goldman-Rakic, 1989).A substantial number of neurons was observed in the supratemporalplane and the superior temporal gyrus. In the supratemporalplane, neurons were mainly located in the cortex of the circularsulcus, involving areas PaI and ProK, whereas in the superior temporal gyrus distinct clusters of neurons occurred in areas TS1,TS2, TS3, paAlt and Tpt. A large number of labelled neurons wereobserved in areas TAa, TPO and PGa on the upper bank of thesuperior temporal sulcus. On the lower bank of this sulcus, scatteredneurons were seen in areas TEa and FST. These inputs are consistentwith the results of investigations that examined the projections frominjections of anterograde tracers into the superior temporal gyrus(Petrides &amp; Pandya, 1988; Romanski et al., 1999) and the upper bankof the superior temporal sulcus (Seltzer &amp; Pandya, 1989). Thesestudies demonstrated terminations to the ventrolateral region herede∆ned as area 45, although these connections were not described asterminating in area 45 but rather in a part of area 12.</Quotation>

In the supratemporalplane, neurons were mainly located in the cortex of the circularsulcus, involving areas PaI and ProK, whereas in the superior temporal gyrus distinct clusters of neurons occurred in areas TS1,TS2, TS3, paAlt and Tpt. A large number of labelled neurons wereobserved in areas TAa, TPO and PGa on the upper bank of thesuperior temporal sulcus. On the lower bank of this sulcus, scatteredneurons were seen in areas TEa and FST. These inputs are consistentwith the results of investigations that examined the projections frominjections of anterograde tracers into the superior temporal gyrus(Petrides &amp; Pandya, 1988; Romanski et al., 1999) and the upper bankof the superior temporal sulcus (Seltzer &amp; Pandya, 1989). Thesestudies demonstrated terminations to the ventrolateral region herede∆ned as area 45, although these connections were not described asterminating in area 45 but rather in a part of area 12.</Quotation>

The connections observed in case 1 were replicated in case 2, a signiÆcant difference being the additional connections with the rostral inferotemporal cortex (area TE) in case 2. These additional connections were probably largely due to the limited spreading of the injection to area 47/12 (as can be seen from the pattern of connections when area 47/12 was injected: cases 4 and 5). In case 2, there was a signiÆcant number of labelled neurons in layers III and V in the cortex within and below the sulcus principalis, involving areas 46, 9/46v, 47/12 and 8Av.

On the medial surface, labelled neurons were clustered in areas 6, 8B, 9, 10 and 14, again in both the supragranular and infragranular layers. In addition, there were labelled cells in the anterior cingulate region in areas 32 and 24. Caudal to the injection, the labelled neurons were located in both banks of the lower limb of the arcuate sulcus, involving areas 45B and 44.

In the supratemporal plane, the neurons were located mainly in area PaI, Reit and ProK. Architectonic areas TS1,TS2, TS3 (Fig. 12C), PaAlt and Tpt of the superior temporal gyrus exhibited a substantial number of labelled neurons in layers III and V (Fig. 11). The cortex of the upper bank of the superior temporal sulcus displayed a large number of labelled neurons involving all divisions of area TPO (Fig. 12B) and PGa as well as area TAa. In the lower bank, some neurons were observed in areas TEa and FST. In the inferotemporal region, labelled neurons could be seen in areas TE1 and TE2.

<Quotation>In case 2, the FB injections were placed in area 45, involving cortex both on the ventrolateral convexity and in the adjacent rostral bank of the arcuate sulcus (Figs 9 and 11A). The connections observed in case 1 were replicated in case 2, a signiÆcant difference being the additional connections with the rostral inferotemporal cortex (area TE) in case 2. These additional connections were probably largely due to the limited spreading of the injection to area 47/12 (as can be seen from the pattern of connections when area 47/12 was injected: cases 4 and 5). In case 2, there was a signiÆcant number of labelled neurons in layers III and V in the cortex within and below the sulcus principalis, involving areas 46, 9/46v, 47/12 and 8Av. On the orbital surface of the frontal lobe, labelled neurons could be observed in areas 47/12, 13, 11, 10 and 14, both in supragranular and infragranular layers. In the dorsolateral frontal cortex, labelled neurons in supragranular and infragranular layers could be observed, as in case 1, in areas 8Ad, 8B, 9, 10 and 46. On the medial surface, labelled neurons were clustered in areas 6, 8B, 9, 10 and 14, again in both the supragranular and infragranular layers. In addition, there were labelled cells in the anterior cingulate region in areas 32 and 24. Caudal to the injection, the labelled neurons were located in both banks of the lower limb of the arcuate sulcus, involving areas 45B and 44. Labelled neurons were also observed in SII and the insula. As in case 1, there were neurons in the supratemporal plane and the superior temporal gyrus in layers III and V. In the supratemporal plane, the neurons were located mainly in area PaI, Reit and ProK. Architectonic areas TS1,TS2, TS3 (Fig. 12C), PaAlt and Tpt of the superior temporal gyrus exhibited a substantial number of labelled neurons in layers III and V (Fig. 11). The cortex of the upper bank of the superior temporal sulcus displayed a large number of labelled neurons involving all divisions of area TPO (Fig. 12B) and PGa as well as area TAa.

<Quotation>In case 2, the FB injections were placed in area 45, involving cortex both on the ventrolateral convexity and in the adjacent rostral bank of the arcuate sulcus (Figs 9 and 11A). The connections observed in case 1 were replicated in case 2, a signiÆcant difference being the additional connections with the rostral inferotemporal cortex (area TE) in case 2. These additional connections were probably largely due to the limited spreading of the injection to area 47/12 (as can be seen from the pattern of connections when area 47/12 was injected: cases 4 and 5). In case 2, there was a signiÆcant number of labelled neurons in layers III and V in the cortex within and below the sulcus principalis, involving areas 46, 9/46v, 47/12 and 8Av. On the orbital surface of the frontal lobe, labelled neurons could be observed in areas 47/12, 13, 11, 10 and 14, both in supragranular and infragranular layers. In the dorsolateral frontal cortex, labelled neurons in supragranular and infragranular layers could be observed, as in case 1, in areas 8Ad, 8B, 9, 10 and 46. On the medial surface, labelled neurons were clustered in areas 6, 8B, 9, 10 and 14, again in both the supragranular and infragranular layers. In addition, there were labelled cells in the anterior cingulate region in areas 32 and 24. Caudal to the injection, the labelled neurons were located in both banks of the lower limb of the arcuate sulcus, involving areas 45B and 44. Labelled neurons were also observed in SII and the insula. As in case 1, there were neurons in the supratemporal plane and the superior temporal gyrus in layers III and V. In the supratemporal plane, the neurons were located mainly in area PaI, Reit and ProK. Architectonic areas TS1,TS2, TS3 (Fig. 12C), PaAlt and Tpt of the superior temporal gyrus exhibited a substantial number of labelled neurons in layers III and V (Fig. 11). The cortex of the upper bank of the superior temporal sulcus displayed a large number of labelled neurons involving all divisions of area TPO (Fig. 12B) and PGa as well as area TAa. In the lower bank, some neurons were observed in areas TEa and FST. In the inferotemporal region, labelled neurons could be seen in areas TE1 and TE2. Ventromedially, a few neurons were observed in rostral area TL as deÆned by Rosene &amp; Pandya (1983).</Quotation>

<Quotation>In case 2, the FB injections were placed in area 45, involving cortex both on the ventrolateral convexity and in the adjacent rostral bank of the arcuate sulcus (Figs 9 and 11A). The connections observed in case 1 were replicated in case 2, a signiÆcant difference being the additional connections with the rostral inferotemporal cortex (area TE) in case 2. These additional connections were probably largely due to the limited spreading of the injection to area 47/12 (as can be seen from the pattern of connections when area 47/12 was injected: cases 4 and 5). In case 2, there was a signiÆcant number of labelled neurons in layers III and V in the cortex within and below the sulcus principalis, involving areas 46, 9/46v, 47/12 and 8Av. On the orbital surface of the frontal lobe, labelled neurons could be observed in areas 47/12, 13, 11, 10 and 14, both in supragranular and infragranular layers. In the dorsolateral frontal cortex, labelled neurons in supragranular and infragranular layers could be observed, as in case 1, in areas 8Ad, 8B, 9, 10 and 46. On the medial surface, labelled neurons were clustered in areas 6, 8B, 9, 10 and 14, again in both the supragranular and infragranular layers. In addition, there were labelled cells in the anterior cingulate region in areas 32 and 24. Caudal to the injection, the labelled neurons were located in both banks of the lower limb of the arcuate sulcus, involving areas 45B and 44. Labelled neurons were also observed in SII and the insula. As in case 1, there were neurons in the supratemporal plane and the superior temporal gyrus in layers III and V. In the supratemporal plane, the neurons were located mainly in area PaI, Reit and ProK. Architectonic areas TS1,TS2, TS3 (Fig. 12C), PaAlt and Tpt of the superior temporal gyrus exhibited a substantial number of labelled neurons in layers III and V (Fig. 11). The cortex of the upper bank of the superior temporal sulcus displayed a large number of labelled neurons involving all divisions of area TPO (Fig. 12B) and PGa as well as area TAa. In the lower bank, some neurons were observed in areas TEa and FST. In the inferotemporal region, labelled neurons could be seen in areas TE1 and TE2. Ventromedially, a few neurons were observed in rostral area TL as deÆned by Rosene &amp; Pandya (1983).</Quotation>

In case 2, there was a signiÆcant number of labelled neurons in layers III and V in the cortex within and below the sulcus principalis, involving areas 46, 9/46v, 47/12 and 8Av. On the orbital surface of the frontal lobe, labelled neurons could be observed in areas 47/12, 13, 11, 10 and 14, both in supragranular and infragranular layers. In the dorsolateral frontal cortex, labelled neurons in supragranular and infragranular layers could be observed, as in case 1, in areas 8Ad, 8B, 9, 10 and 46. On the medial surface, labelled neurons were clustered in areas 6, 8B, 9, 10 and 14, again in both the supragranular and infragranular layers. In addition, there were labelled cells in the anterior cingulate region in areas 32 and 24. Caudal to the injection, the labelled neurons were located in both banks of the lower limb of the arcuate sulcus, involving areas 45B and 44. Labelled neurons were also observed in SII and the insula. As in case 1, there were neurons in the supratemporal plane and the superior temporal gyrus in layers III and V. In the supratemporal plane, the neurons were located mainly in area PaI, Reit and ProK. Architectonic areas TS1,TS2, TS3 (Fig. 12C), PaAlt and Tpt of the superior temporal gyrus exhibited a substantial number of labelled neurons in layers III and V (Fig. 11). The cortex of the upper bank of the superior temporal sulcus displayed a large number of labelled neurons involving all divisions of area TPO (Fig. 12B) and PGa as well as area TAa. In the lower bank, some neurons were observed in areas TEa and FST. In the inferotemporal region, labelled neurons could be seen in areas TE1 and TE2. Ventromedially, a few neurons were observed in rostral area TL as deÆned by Rosene &amp; Pandya (1983).</Quotation>

<Quotation>In case 4, FB injections were placed in the caudal part of orbital area 47/12 (Figs 9 and 14A), whereas in case 5, DY injections were placed in the rostral part of orbital 47/12 (Figs 9 and 15A). The pattern of labelled neurons in these two cases was similar, but with a few differences. Labelled neurons were observed in areas 9/46v and 45, and, on the orbital surface, in areas 13 and 11 in supragranular and infragranular layers. Only case 4 (ventrocaudal area 47/12) had labelled neurons on the dorsolateral surface of the frontal lobe, in areas 9 and 10 (Fig. 14A). On the medial surface, some neurons were observed in area 9 and the cingulate areas 32 and 24, in case 4 (Fig. 14B), and only in area 24 in case 5 (Fig. 15B). Both cases displayed neurons in area 44, as well as in the ventral part of area 6. These connections with the ventral premotor region are consistent with earlier studies that examined the connections of the ventral premotor (Barbas &amp; Pandya, 1987) or area 12 (Barbas &amp; Pandya, 1989; Carmichael &amp; Price, 1995). The peri-central operculum also showed labelled neurons in both cases ± in area SII and in the insula (Fig. 14A and 15A). In case 5 (Fig. 15A), there were also some neurons in area PF and in the adjacent lower bank of the intraparietal sulcus. These somatosensory-related connections are consistent with other studies that examined the connections of this region (Barbas, 1988; Carmichael &amp; Price, 1995).Strong connections with the inferotemporal region were observed in cases 4 and 5. Many labelled neurons were observed in area TEa in the lower bank of the superior temporal sulcus, as well as in areas TE1 and TE2. Finally, both cases had labelled neurons in the rostral part of the perirhinal cortex, as well as in area TL of the parahippocampal gyrus. These connections are in agreement with earlier results by Barbas (1988) and Carmichael &amp; Price (1995) who also concluded that there is strong input from rostral inferotemporal cortex to the region labelled here as area 47/12.</Quotation>

These connections with the ventral premotor region are consistent with earlier studies that examined the connections of the ventral premotor (Barbas &amp; Pandya, 1987) or area 12 (Barbas &amp; Pandya, 1989; Carmichael &amp; Price, 1995). The peri-central operculum also showed labelled neurons in both cases ± in area SII and in the insula (Fig. 14A and 15A). In case 5 (Fig. 15A), there were also some neurons in area PF and in the adjacent lower bank of the intraparietal sulcus. These somatosensory-related connections are consistent with other studies that examined the connections of this region (Barbas, 1988; Carmichael &amp; Price, 1995).Strong connections with the inferotemporal region were observed in cases 4 and 5. Many labelled neurons were observed in area TEa in the lower bank of the superior temporal sulcus, as well as in areas TE1 and TE2. Finally, both cases had labelled neurons in the rostral part of the perirhinal cortex, as well as in area TL of the parahippocampal gyrus. These connections are in agreement with earlier results by Barbas (1988) and Carmichael &amp; Price (1995) who also concluded that there is strong input from rostral inferotemporal cortex to the region labelled here as area 47/12.</Quotation>

<Quotation>In case 4, FB injections were placed in the caudal part of orbital area 47/12 (Figs 9 and 14A), whereas in case 5, DY injections were placed in the rostral part of orbital 47/12 (Figs 9 and 15A). The pattern of labelled neurons in these two cases was similar, but with a few differences. Labelled neurons were observed in areas 9/46v and 45, and, on the orbital surface, in areas 13 and 11 in supragranular and infragranular layers. Only case 4 (ventrocaudal area 47/12) had labelled neurons on the dorsolateral surface of the frontal lobe, in areas 9 and 10 (Fig. 14A).

The pattern of labelled neurons in these two cases was similar, but with a few differences. Labelled neurons were observed in areas 9/46v and 45, and, on the orbital surface, in areas 13 and 11 in supragranular and infragranular layers. Only case 4 (ventrocaudal area 47/12) had labelled neurons on the dorsolateral surface of the frontal lobe, in areas 9 and 10 (Fig. 14A). On the medial surface, some neurons were observed in area 9 and the cingulate areas 32 and 24, in case 4 (Fig. 14B), and only in area 24 in case 5 (Fig. 15B). Both cases displayed neurons in area 44, as well as in the ventral part of area 6. These connections with the ventral premotor region are consistent with earlier studies that examined the connections of the ventral premotor (Barbas &amp; Pandya, 1987) or area 12 (Barbas &amp; Pandya, 1989; Carmichael &amp; Price, 1995). The peri-central operculum also showed labelled neurons in both cases ± in area SII and in the insula (Fig. 14A and 15A). In case 5 (Fig. 15A), there were also some neurons in area PF and in the adjacent lower bank of the intraparietal sulcus. These somatosensory-related connections are consistent with other studies that examined the connections of this region (Barbas, 1988; Carmichael &amp; Price, 1995).Strong connections with the inferotemporal region were observed in cases 4 and 5. Many labelled neurons were observed in area TEa in the lower bank of the superior temporal sulcus, as well as in areas TE1 and TE2. Finally, both cases had labelled neurons in the rostral part of the perirhinal cortex, as well as in area TL of the parahippocampal gyrus. These connections are in agreement with earlier results by Barbas (1988) and Carmichael &amp; Price (1995) who also concluded that there is strong input from rostral inferotemporal cortex to the region labelled here as area 47/12.</Quotation>

<Quotation>In case 4, FB injections were placed in the caudal part of orbital area 47/12 (Figs 9 and 14A), whereas in case 5, DY injections were placed in the rostral part of orbital 47/12 (Figs 9 and 15A). The pattern of labelled neurons in these two cases was similar, but with a few differences. Labelled neurons were observed in areas 9/46v and 45, and, on the orbital surface, in areas 13 and 11 in supragranular and infragranular layers. Only case 4 (ventrocaudal area 47/12) had labelled neurons on the dorsolateral surface of the frontal lobe, in areas 9 and 10 (Fig. 14A). On the medial surface, some neurons were observed in area 9 and the cingulate areas 32 and 24, in case 4 (Fig. 14B), and only in area 24 in case 5 (Fig. 15B). Both cases displayed neurons in area 44, as well as in the ventral part of area 6. These connections with the ventral premotor region are consistent with earlier studies that examined the connections of the ventral premotor (Barbas &amp; Pandya, 1987) or area 12 (Barbas &amp; Pandya, 1989; Carmichael &amp; Price, 1995). The peri-central operculum also showed labelled neurons in both cases ± in area SII and in the insula (Fig. 14A and 15A). In case 5 (Fig. 15A), there were also some neurons in area PF and in the adjacent lower bank of the intraparietal sulcus. These somatosensory-related connections are consistent with other studies that examined the connections of this region (Barbas, 1988; Carmichael &amp; Price, 1995).Strong connections with the inferotemporal region were observed in cases 4 and 5. Many labelled neurons were observed in area TEa in the lower bank of the superior temporal sulcus, as well as in areas TE1 and TE2. Finally, both cases had labelled neurons in the rostral part of the perirhinal cortex, as well as in area TL of the parahippocampal gyrus. These connections are in agreement with earlier results by Barbas (1988) and Carmichael &amp; Price (1995) who also concluded that there is strong input from rostral inferotemporal cortex to the region labelled here as area 47/12.</Quotation>

<Quotation>In this case, the DY injections were placed in the lateral part ofarea 47/12 (Figs 9 and 13A). There was some spreading of thedye into the ventralmost part of area 45. Labelled neurons werenoted in area 10, area 8Av and area 45, in both the supra andinfragranular layers. On the orbital surface, a distinct cluster ofneurons was noted in areas 47/12, 13, 11, 10 and 14, in layers IIIand V. In the dorsolateral frontal cortex, labelled neurons wereobserved in areas 46, 8B, 9 and 10. On the medial surface, asmall cluster of neurons was seen in area 9, 10 and 14 (Fig. 13B).Only a limited number of neurons was seen in the rostral part ofarea 24 and 32. In the temporal lobe, areas Pro, TS1 and TS2 exhibited a few labelled neurons. Labelled neurons were alsoobserved in areas TAa, TPO and PGa, in the upper bank of thesuperior temporal sulcus. In the lower bank of this sulcus,labelled neurons were located in areas IPa and TEa. The ventralpart of the temporal lobe had labelled neurons in area TE1 and inthe rostral part of area TL, as well as the perirhinal cortex.</Quotation>

<Quotation>In this case, the DY injections involved area 9/46v in the ventral lip of the sulcus principalis and the adjacent cortex (Figs 9 and 16A). Labelled cells in layers III and V were seen in area 47/12, on the ventrolateral frontal cortex, and in areas 13 and 11, on the orbital surface. On the medial surface, only a few cells were observed in area 24a of the cingulate gyrus and in area 24c in the depth of the cingulate sulcus (Fig. 16B). Posterior to the injection site on the lateral surface, the major cluster of neurons was in ventral area 6, area 44 and area ProM. The peri-central operculum in the upper bank of the Sylvian Æssure (i.e. areas 1, 2 and SII) contained a substantial number of labelled neurons in both the supragranular and infra-granular layers. In the insula, cells were observed in its rostral dysgranular part. In the parietal cortex, areas PF and PFG (Fig. 12A) displayed labelled neurons in layers III and V, these extending into adjacent cortex in the intraparietal sulcus (area POa). These connection patterns are in agreement with those previously reported for this region (Barbas &amp; Mesulam, 1985; Preuss &amp; Goldman-Rakic, 1989).</Quotation>

<Quotation>In this case, the DY injections involved area 9/46v in the ventral lip of the sulcus principalis and the adjacent cortex (Figs 9 and 16A). Labelled cells in layers III and V were seen in area 47/12, on the ventrolateral frontal cortex, and in areas 13 and 11, on the orbital surface. On the medial surface, only a few cells were observed in area 24a of the cingulate gyrus and in area 24c in the depth of the cingulate sulcus (Fig. 16B). Posterior to the injection site on the lateral surface, the major cluster of neurons was in ventral area 6, area 44 and area ProM. The peri-central operculum in the upper bank of the Sylvian Æssure (i.e. areas 1, 2 and SII) contained a substantial number of labelled neurons in both the supragranular and infra-granular layers. In the insula, cells were observed in its rostral dysgranular part. In the parietal cortex, areas PF and PFG (Fig. 12A) displayed labelled neurons in layers III and V, these extending into adjacent cortex in the intraparietal sulcus (area POa). These connection patterns are in agreement with those previously reported for this region (Barbas &amp; Mesulam, 1985; Preuss &amp; Goldman-Rakic, 1989).</Quotation>

In the insula, cells were observed in its rostral dysgranular part. In the parietal cortex, areas PF and PFG (Fig. 12A) displayed labelled neurons in layers III and V, these extending into adjacent cortex in the intraparietal sulcus (area POa). These connection patterns are in agreement with those previously reported for this region (Barbas &amp; Mesulam, 1985; Preuss &amp; Goldman-Rakic, 1989).</Quotation>

The peri-central operculum in the upper bank of the Sylvian Æssure (i.e. areas 1, 2 and SII) contained a substantial number of labelled neurons in both the supragranular and infra-granular layers. In the insula, cells were observed in its rostral dysgranular part. In the parietal cortex, areas PF and PFG (Fig. 12A) displayed labelled neurons in layers III and V, these extending into adjacent cortex in the intraparietal sulcus (area POa). These connection patterns are in agreement with those previously reported for this region (Barbas &amp; Mesulam, 1985; Preuss &amp; Goldman-Rakic, 1989).</Quotation>
