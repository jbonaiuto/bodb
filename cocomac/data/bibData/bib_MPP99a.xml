<Quotation>&amp;quot;On the medial surface of the frontal lobe, the labeled terminals were noted in areas 9 and 8B. Labeled fibers leaving the injection site were observed to take a medial course to enter the cingulum bundle. These fibers coursed posteriorly, within the cingulum bundle, along the full extent of the cingulate gyrus (Fig. 2, sections 2-4 and Fig. 3B). Along its course, this fiber system gave rise to a number of labeled terminals in the posterior cingulate areas 23 and 31 and in the rostral part of the retrosplenial cortical areas 30 and 29, both its medial (29d) and lateral (29a-c) subdivision (Fig. 2, sections 4 and 5). The terminations targeted layer I, as well as the deeper layers. Further posteriorly, this contingent of fibers turned ventrally, in an arch-like manner, around the splenium (Fig. 3, C and D) to terminate in the posteroventral segment of the retrosplenial area 30 (Fig. 3E). An appreciable portion of these fibers continues further ventrally and courses into the medullary core of the posterior parahippocampal gyrus to terminate primarily in layer II of the caudal portion of the presubiculum (Fig. 2, section 5 and Fig. 4). At that level, a small portion of these fibers, which form part of the white matter of the posterior parahippocampal gyrus, perforate the pyramidal cell layers of the presubiculum and gather into layer I (Fig. 4C) in the so-called superficial presubicular path (Rosene and Van Hoesen, 1987).&amp;quot;</Quotation>

Further posteriorly, this contingent of fibers turned ventrally, in an arch-like manner, around the splenium (Fig. 3, C and D) to terminate in the posteroventral segment of the retrosplenial area 30 (Fig. 3E). An appreciable portion of these fibers continues further ventrally and courses into the medullary core of the posterior parahippocampal gyrus to terminate primarily in layer II of the caudal portion of the presubiculum (Fig. 2, section 5 and Fig. 4). At that level, a small portion of these fibers, which form part of the white matter of the posterior parahippocampal gyrus, perforate the pyramidal cell layers of the presubiculum and gather into layer I (Fig. 4C) in the so-called superficial presubicular path (Rosene and Van Hoesen, 1987).&amp;quot;</Quotation>

<Quotation>&amp;quot;On the medial surface of the frontal lobe, the labeled terminals were noted in areas 9 and 8B. Labeled fibers leaving the injection site were observed to take a medial course to enter the cingulum bundle. These fibers coursed posteriorly, within the cingulum bundle, along the full extent of the cingulate gyrus (Fig. 2, sections 2-4 and Fig. 3B). Along its course, this fiber system gave rise to a number of labeled terminals in the posterior cingulate areas 23 and 31 and in the rostral part of the retrosplenial cortical areas 30 and 29, both its medial (29d) and lateral (29a-c) subdivision (Fig. 2, sections 4 and 5). The terminations targeted layer I, as well as the deeper layers.

<Quotation>&amp;quot;In the vicinity of the injection, labeled terminals were observed in areas 10, 14, 24, and 32 located on the medial surface of the frontal lobe. As in the previous case, the labeled fibers gathered in the cingulum bundle. The labeled fibers in the cingulum bundle continued caudally up to the level of the splenium of the corpus callosum. Unlike the previous case, the labeled grains in areas 24 and 23 were extensive. Additional terminals were observed in area 31 of the posterior cingulate gyrus, and into the dorsal and the posteroventral aspects of both areas 29 and 30. The terminations were predominantly in the deeper layers with some in layer I. Terminals were observed in both the medial (29d) and lateral (29a-c) subdivisions of are[a] 29. A few labeled terminals were noted into the caudal part of the presubiculum.&amp;quot;</Quotation>

<Quotation>&amp;quot;In the vicinity of the injection, labeled terminals were observed in areas 10, 14, 24, and 32 located on the medial surface of the frontal lobe. As in the previous case, the labeled fibers gathered in the cingulum bundle. The labeled fibers in the cingulum bundle continued caudally up to the level of the splenium of the corpus callosum. Unlike the previous case, the labeled grains in areas 24 and 23 were extensive. Additional terminals were observed in area 31 of the posterior cingulate gyrus, and into the dorsal and the posteroventral aspects of both areas 29 and 30. The terminations were predominantly in the deeper layers with some in layer I. Terminals were observed in both the medial (29d) and lateral (29a-c) subdivisions of are[a] 29. A few labeled terminals were noted into the caudal part of the presubiculum.&amp;quot;</Quotation>

<Quotation>&amp;quot;Near the injection site, labeled grains were noted in the anterior portion of the cingulate gyrus, in areas 24 and 32, as well as in area 10. In this case, the labeled fibers took a ventromedial course to join the cingulum bundle. Labeled fibers were observed around the full length of the cingulum bundle. At the level of the splenium of the corpus callosium, the fiber pathway terminated [in] the posterior cingulate area 23, located dorsal to the commissure, as well as in the dorsal and the posteroventral retrosplenial area 30. The termination in the latter area were predominantly in layer I, with a few in the deeper layers. A small number of labeled grains were noted in area TF of the posterior parahippocampal gyrus. &amp;quot;&amp;quot;In cases 4 and 5, in addition to the fibers contained in the cingulum bundle, there was an additional fiber pathway that coursed ventromedially toward the uncinate bundle (see Figs. 7,8).&amp;quot;...[These fibers] &amp;quot;terminated in the entorhinal cortex and the amygdala.&amp;quot;</Quotation>

<Quotation>&amp;quot;Labeled terminals were present in nearby areas 10, 24, 32, 25, 14, and medial areas 9 and 8. The cingulum bundle contained labeled fibers up to the level of the splenium of the corpus callosum. Along its course, the labeled terminals were present in areas 24b and in the rostral part of area 23b. Labeled terminals were also observed in the dorsal and in the posteroventral aspects of retrosplenial ares 30 and the medial subdivision of area 29 (i.e., 29d). The terminations in area 30 were observed in all layers with a predilection for layer I. In area 29, the terminations were observed in all layers with a predilection for layer I. In area 29, the terminations were observed in both the deeper and upper layers. some of the labeled fibers continued around the splenium to terminate into the caudal part of the presubiculum.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;In cases 4 and 5, in addition to the fibers contained in the cingulum bundle, there was an additional fiber pathway that coursed ventromedially toward the uncinate bundle (see Figs. 7,8).&amp;quot;...[These fibers] &amp;quot;terminated in the entorhinal cortex and the amygdala.&amp;quot;</Quotation>

<Quotation>&amp;quot;Labeled terminals were present in nearby areas 10, 24, 32, 25, 14, and medial areas 9 and 8. The cingulum bundle contained labeled fibers up to the level of the splenium of the corpus callosum. Along its course, the labeled terminals were present in areas 24b and in the rostral part of area 23b. Labeled terminals were also observed in the dorsal and in the posteroventral aspects of retrosplenial ares 30 and the medial subdivision of area 29 (i.e., 29d). The terminations in area 30 were observed in all layers with a predilection for layer I. In area 29, the terminations were observed in all layers with a predilection for layer I. In area 29, the terminations were observed in both the deeper and upper layers. some of the labeled fibers continued around the splenium to terminate into the caudal part of the presubiculum.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;In cases 4 and 5, in addition to the fibers contained in the cingulum bundle, there was an additional fiber pathway that coursed ventromedially toward the uncinate bundle (see Figs. 7,8).&amp;quot;...[These fibers] &amp;quot;terminated in the entorhinal cortex and the amygdala.&amp;quot;</Quotation>
