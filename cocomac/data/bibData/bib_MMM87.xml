<Quotation>&amp;quot;This injection site was in the anterolateral portion of dorsal  TP (Fig. 2A). It was centered mainly in the granular sectors of TP (TPg) (Fig. 3, section 6, 7). Rostrally, the injection site spread to the anterior dysgranular portion of TP (TPdg) (Fig. 3, section 5). The HRP reaction product did not extend to Tpa-p or POC. The needle tract did not penetrate the white matter.&amp;quot; (p. 90)</Quotation>

<Quotation>&amp;quot;Cortical labeling was remarkably selective. Almost all labeled neurons were found in the anterior half of the temporal lobe, in orbitofrontal cortex, and in the medial frontal region (Figs. 3-5).&amp;quot; (p. 91)&amp;quot;The total numbers of labeled cortical (including POC and hippocampus) and amygdaloid neurons were quite comparable in cases A-C. These numbers were 3,443 in case A, 3,822 in case B, and 3,373 in case C. However, the distribution of theses neurons showed differences. For example, in case A, which had the dorsal HRP injection site, 33% of all retrogradely labeled neurons were situated in auditory association cortex of the superior temporal gyrus. This percentage was 6% and 13% for cases B and C, respectively. Visual association input from inferotemporal cortex, was substantial (9%) only in case C with the ventral TP injection site, whereas this proportion was no more than 1% in the other two cases. Amygdaloid and olfactory input also showed consistent differences. Thus, 18% and 13% of all labeled cortical and amygdaloid neurons in cases C and B were located in the amygdala whereas this percentage fell to 5% in case A. Although labeled POC neurons never constituted more than 1% of the total retrograde labeling, they were more numerous in cases B and C.In each of the three HRP cases, virtually all of the positive labeled perikarya were found in layers 3, 5, and 6. The proportion of labeled neurons located in the supra- and infragranular layers varied from region to region in a pattern that was consistent in all the cases. Thus, neurons that projected to TP from isocortical association areas (e.g., areas TA, TE, prefrontal cortex) were more heavily concentrated within supragranular layers whereas the projections from nonisocortical paralimbic areas (e.g., OFdg, entorhinal) tended to arise predominantly from deeper layers of cortex.&amp;quot; (p. 98)</Quotation>

The proportion of labeled neurons located in the supra- and infragranular layers varied from region to region in a pattern that was consistent in all the cases. Thus, neurons that projected to TP from isocortical association areas (e.g., areas TA, TE, prefrontal cortex) were more heavily concentrated within supragranular layers whereas the projections from nonisocortical paralimbic areas (e.g., OFdg, entorhinal) tended to arise predominantly from deeper layers of cortex.&amp;quot; (p. 98)</Quotation>

<Quotation>&amp;quot;Cortical labeling was remarkably selective. Almost all labeled neurons were found in the anterior half of the temporal lobe, in orbitofrontal cortex, and in the medial frontal region (Figs. 3-5).&amp;quot; (p. 91)&amp;quot;The total numbers of labeled cortical (including POC and hippocampus) and amygdaloid neurons were quite comparable in cases A-C. These numbers were 3,443 in case A, 3,822 in case B, and 3,373 in case C. However, the distribution of theses neurons showed differences. For example, in case A, which had the dorsal HRP injection site, 33% of all retrogradely labeled neurons were situated in auditory association cortex of the superior temporal gyrus. This percentage was 6% and 13% for cases B and C, respectively. Visual association input from inferotemporal cortex, was substantial (9%) only in case C with the ventral TP injection site, whereas this proportion was no more than 1% in the other two cases. Amygdaloid and olfactory input also showed consistent differences. Thus, 18% and 13% of all labeled cortical and amygdaloid neurons in cases C and B were located in the amygdala whereas this percentage fell to 5% in case A. Although labeled POC neurons never constituted more than 1% of the total retrograde labeling, they were more numerous in cases B and C.In each of the three HRP cases, virtually all of the positive labeled perikarya were found in layers 3, 5, and 6. The proportion of labeled neurons located in the supra- and infragranular layers varied from region to region in a pattern that was consistent in all the cases. Thus, neurons that projected to TP from isocortical association areas (e.g., areas TA, TE, prefrontal cortex) were more heavily concentrated within supragranular layers whereas the projections from nonisocortical paralimbic areas (e.g., OFdg, entorhinal) tended to arise predominantly from deeper layers of cortex.&amp;quot; (p. 98)</Quotation>

<Quotation>&amp;quot;Cortical labeling was remarkably selective. Almost all labeled neurons were found in the anterior half of the temporal lobe, in orbitofrontal cortex, and in the medial frontal region (Figs. 3-5).&amp;quot; (p. 91)&amp;quot;The total numbers of labeled cortical (including POC and hippocampus) and amygdaloid neurons were quite comparable in cases A-C. These numbers were 3,443 in case A, 3,822 in case B, and 3,373 in case C. However, the distribution of theses neurons showed differences. For example, in case A, which had the dorsal HRP injection site, 33% of all retrogradely labeled neurons were situated in auditory association cortex of the superior temporal gyrus. This percentage was 6% and 13% for cases B and C, respectively. Visual association input from inferotemporal cortex, was substantial (9%) only in case C with the ventral TP injection site, whereas this proportion was no more than 1% in the other two cases. Amygdaloid and olfactory input also showed consistent differences. Thus, 18% and 13% of all labeled cortical and amygdaloid neurons in cases C and B were located in the amygdala whereas this percentage fell to 5% in case A. Although labeled POC neurons never constituted more than 1% of the total retrograde labeling, they were more numerous in cases B and C.In each of the three HRP cases, virtually all of the positive labeled perikarya were found in layers 3, 5, and 6. The proportion of labeled neurons located in the supra- and infragranular layers varied from region to region in a pattern that was consistent in all the cases. Thus, neurons that projected to TP from isocortical association areas (e.g., areas TA, TE, prefrontal cortex) were more heavily concentrated within supragranular layers whereas the projections from nonisocortical paralimbic areas (e.g., OFdg, entorhinal) tended to arise predominantly from deeper layers of cortex.&amp;quot; (p. 98)</Quotation>

These numbers were 3,443 in case A, 3,822 in case B, and 3,373 in case C. However, the distribution of theses neurons showed differences. For example, in case A, which had the dorsal HRP injection site, 33% of all retrogradely labeled neurons were situated in auditory association cortex of the superior temporal gyrus. This percentage was 6% and 13% for cases B and C, respectively. Visual association input from inferotemporal cortex, was substantial (9%) only in case C with the ventral TP injection site, whereas this proportion was no more than 1% in the other two cases. Amygdaloid and olfactory input also showed consistent differences. Thus, 18% and 13% of all labeled cortical and amygdaloid neurons in cases C and B were located in the amygdala whereas this percentage fell to 5% in case A. Although labeled POC neurons never constituted more than 1% of the total retrograde labeling, they were more numerous in cases B and C.In each of the three HRP cases, virtually all of the positive labeled perikarya were found in layers 3, 5, and 6. The proportion of labeled neurons located in the supra- and infragranular layers varied from region to region in a pattern that was consistent in all the cases. Thus, neurons that projected to TP from isocortical association areas (e.g., areas TA, TE, prefrontal cortex) were more heavily concentrated within supragranular layers whereas the projections from nonisocortical paralimbic areas (e.g., OFdg, entorhinal) tended to arise predominantly from deeper layers of cortex.&amp;quot; (p. 98)</Quotation>

Visual association input from inferotemporal cortex, was substantial (9%) only in case C with the ventral TP injection site, whereas this proportion was no more than 1% in the other two cases. Amygdaloid and olfactory input also showed consistent differences. Thus, 18% and 13% of all labeled cortical and amygdaloid neurons in cases C and B were located in the amygdala whereas this percentage fell to 5% in case A. Although labeled POC neurons never constituted more than 1% of the total retrograde labeling, they were more numerous in cases B and C.In each of the three HRP cases, virtually all of the positive labeled perikarya were found in layers 3, 5, and 6. The proportion of labeled neurons located in the supra- and infragranular layers varied from region to region in a pattern that was consistent in all the cases. Thus, neurons that projected to TP from isocortical association areas (e.g., areas TA, TE, prefrontal cortex) were more heavily concentrated within supragranular layers whereas the projections from nonisocortical paralimbic areas (e.g., OFdg, entorhinal) tended to arise predominantly from deeper layers of cortex.&amp;quot; (p. 98)</Quotation>

<Quotation>&amp;quot;Cortical labeling was remarkably selective. Almost all labeled neurons were found in the anterior half of the temporal lobe, in orbitofrontal cortex, and in the medial frontal region (Figs. 3-5).&amp;quot; (p. 91)&amp;quot;The total numbers of labeled cortical (including POC and hippocampus) and amygdaloid neurons were quite comparable in cases A-C. These numbers were 3,443 in case A, 3,822 in case B, and 3,373 in case C. However, the distribution of theses neurons showed differences. For example, in case A, which had the dorsal HRP injection site, 33% of all retrogradely labeled neurons were situated in auditory association cortex of the superior temporal gyrus. This percentage was 6% and 13% for cases B and C, respectively. Visual association input from inferotemporal cortex, was substantial (9%) only in case C with the ventral TP injection site, whereas this proportion was no more than 1% in the other two cases. Amygdaloid and olfactory input also showed consistent differences. Thus, 18% and 13% of all labeled cortical and amygdaloid neurons in cases C and B were located in the amygdala whereas this percentage fell to 5% in case A. Although labeled POC neurons never constituted more than 1% of the total retrograde labeling, they were more numerous in cases B and C.In each of the three HRP cases, virtually all of the positive labeled perikarya were found in layers 3, 5, and 6. The proportion of labeled neurons located in the supra- and infragranular layers varied from region to region in a pattern that was consistent in all the cases. Thus, neurons that projected to TP from isocortical association areas (e.g., areas TA, TE, prefrontal cortex) were more heavily concentrated within supragranular layers whereas the projections from nonisocortical paralimbic areas (e.g., OFdg, entorhinal) tended to arise predominantly from deeper layers of cortex.&amp;quot; (p. 98)</Quotation>

For example, in case A, which had the dorsal HRP injection site, 33% of all retrogradely labeled neurons were situated in auditory association cortex of the superior temporal gyrus. This percentage was 6% and 13% for cases B and C, respectively. Visual association input from inferotemporal cortex, was substantial (9%) only in case C with the ventral TP injection site, whereas this proportion was no more than 1% in the other two cases. Amygdaloid and olfactory input also showed consistent differences. Thus, 18% and 13% of all labeled cortical and amygdaloid neurons in cases C and B were located in the amygdala whereas this percentage fell to 5% in case A. Although labeled POC neurons never constituted more than 1% of the total retrograde labeling, they were more numerous in cases B and C.In each of the three HRP cases, virtually all of the positive labeled perikarya were found in layers 3, 5, and 6. The proportion of labeled neurons located in the supra- and infragranular layers varied from region to region in a pattern that was consistent in all the cases. Thus, neurons that projected to TP from isocortical association areas (e.g., areas TA, TE, prefrontal cortex) were more heavily concentrated within supragranular layers whereas the projections from nonisocortical paralimbic areas (e.g., OFdg, entorhinal) tended to arise predominantly from deeper layers of cortex.&amp;quot; (p. 98)</Quotation>

Thus, 18% and 13% of all labeled cortical and amygdaloid neurons in cases C and B were located in the amygdala whereas this percentage fell to 5% in case A. Although labeled POC neurons never constituted more than 1% of the total retrograde labeling, they were more numerous in cases B and C.In each of the three HRP cases, virtually all of the positive labeled perikarya were found in layers 3, 5, and 6. The proportion of labeled neurons located in the supra- and infragranular layers varied from region to region in a pattern that was consistent in all the cases. Thus, neurons that projected to TP from isocortical association areas (e.g., areas TA, TE, prefrontal cortex) were more heavily concentrated within supragranular layers whereas the projections from nonisocortical paralimbic areas (e.g., OFdg, entorhinal) tended to arise predominantly from deeper layers of cortex.&amp;quot; (p. 98)</Quotation>

<Quotation>&amp;quot;Cortical labeling was remarkably selective. Almost all labeled neurons were found in the anterior half of the temporal lobe, in orbitofrontal cortex, and in the medial frontal region (Figs. 3-5).&amp;quot; (p. 91)&amp;quot;The total numbers of labeled cortical (including POC and hippocampus) and amygdaloid neurons were quite comparable in cases A-C. These numbers were 3,443 in case A, 3,822 in case B, and 3,373 in case C. However, the distribution of theses neurons showed differences. For example, in case A, which had the dorsal HRP injection site, 33% of all retrogradely labeled neurons were situated in auditory association cortex of the superior temporal gyrus. This percentage was 6% and 13% for cases B and C, respectively. Visual association input from inferotemporal cortex, was substantial (9%) only in case C with the ventral TP injection site, whereas this proportion was no more than 1% in the other two cases. Amygdaloid and olfactory input also showed consistent differences. Thus, 18% and 13% of all labeled cortical and amygdaloid neurons in cases C and B were located in the amygdala whereas this percentage fell to 5% in case A. Although labeled POC neurons never constituted more than 1% of the total retrograde labeling, they were more numerous in cases B and C.In each of the three HRP cases, virtually all of the positive labeled perikarya were found in layers 3, 5, and 6. The proportion of labeled neurons located in the supra- and infragranular layers varied from region to region in a pattern that was consistent in all the cases. Thus, neurons that projected to TP from isocortical association areas (e.g., areas TA, TE, prefrontal cortex) were more heavily concentrated within supragranular layers whereas the projections from nonisocortical paralimbic areas (e.g., OFdg, entorhinal) tended to arise predominantly from deeper layers of cortex.&amp;quot; (p. 98)</Quotation>

Almost all labeled neurons were found in the anterior half of the temporal lobe, in orbitofrontal cortex, and in the medial frontal region (Figs. 3-5).&amp;quot; (p. 91)&amp;quot;The total numbers of labeled cortical (including POC and hippocampus) and amygdaloid neurons were quite comparable in cases A-C. These numbers were 3,443 in case A, 3,822 in case B, and 3,373 in case C. However, the distribution of theses neurons showed differences. For example, in case A, which had the dorsal HRP injection site, 33% of all retrogradely labeled neurons were situated in auditory association cortex of the superior temporal gyrus. This percentage was 6% and 13% for cases B and C, respectively. Visual association input from inferotemporal cortex, was substantial (9%) only in case C with the ventral TP injection site, whereas this proportion was no more than 1% in the other two cases. Amygdaloid and olfactory input also showed consistent differences. Thus, 18% and 13% of all labeled cortical and amygdaloid neurons in cases C and B were located in the amygdala whereas this percentage fell to 5% in case A. Although labeled POC neurons never constituted more than 1% of the total retrograde labeling, they were more numerous in cases B and C.In each of the three HRP cases, virtually all of the positive labeled perikarya were found in layers 3, 5, and 6. The proportion of labeled neurons located in the supra- and infragranular layers varied from region to region in a pattern that was consistent in all the cases. Thus, neurons that projected to TP from isocortical association areas (e.g., areas TA, TE, prefrontal cortex) were more heavily concentrated within supragranular layers whereas the projections from nonisocortical paralimbic areas (e.g., OFdg, entorhinal) tended to arise predominantly from deeper layers of cortex.&amp;quot; (p. 98)</Quotation>

This percentage was 6% and 13% for cases B and C, respectively. Visual association input from inferotemporal cortex, was substantial (9%) only in case C with the ventral TP injection site, whereas this proportion was no more than 1% in the other two cases.

<Quotation>&amp;quot;Cortical labeling was remarkably selective. Almost all labeled neurons were found in the anterior half of the temporal lobe, in orbitofrontal cortex, and in the medial frontal region (Figs. 3-5).&amp;quot; (p. 91)&amp;quot;The total numbers of labeled cortical (including POC and hippocampus) and amygdaloid neurons were quite comparable in cases A-C. These numbers were 3,443 in case A, 3,822 in case B, and 3,373 in case C. However, the distribution of theses neurons showed differences. For example, in case A, which had the dorsal HRP injection site, 33% of all retrogradely labeled neurons were situated in auditory association cortex of the superior temporal gyrus. This percentage was 6% and 13% for cases B and C, respectively. Visual association input from inferotemporal cortex, was substantial (9%) only in case C with the ventral TP injection site, whereas this proportion was no more than 1% in the other two cases. Amygdaloid and olfactory input also showed consistent differences. Thus, 18% and 13% of all labeled cortical and amygdaloid neurons in cases C and B were located in the amygdala whereas this percentage fell to 5% in case A. Although labeled POC neurons never constituted more than 1% of the total retrograde labeling, they were more numerous in cases B and C.In each of the three HRP cases, virtually all of the positive labeled perikarya were found in layers 3, 5, and 6. The proportion of labeled neurons located in the supra- and infragranular layers varied from region to region in a pattern that was consistent in all the cases. Thus, neurons that projected to TP from isocortical association areas (e.g., areas TA, TE, prefrontal cortex) were more heavily concentrated within supragranular layers whereas the projections from nonisocortical paralimbic areas (e.g., OFdg, entorhinal) tended to arise predominantly from deeper layers of cortex.&amp;quot; (p. 98)</Quotation>

Almost all labeled neurons were found in the anterior half of the temporal lobe, in orbitofrontal cortex, and in the medial frontal region (Figs. 3-5).&amp;quot; (p. 91)&amp;quot;The total numbers of labeled cortical (including POC and hippocampus) and amygdaloid neurons were quite comparable in cases A-C. These numbers were 3,443 in case A, 3,822 in case B, and 3,373 in case C. However, the distribution of theses neurons showed differences. For example, in case A, which had the dorsal HRP injection site, 33% of all retrogradely labeled neurons were situated in auditory association cortex of the superior temporal gyrus. This percentage was 6% and 13% for cases B and C, respectively. Visual association input from inferotemporal cortex, was substantial (9%) only in case C with the ventral TP injection site, whereas this proportion was no more than 1% in the other two cases. Amygdaloid and olfactory input also showed consistent differences. Thus, 18% and 13% of all labeled cortical and amygdaloid neurons in cases C and B were located in the amygdala whereas this percentage fell to 5% in case A. Although labeled POC neurons never constituted more than 1% of the total retrograde labeling, they were more numerous in cases B and C.In each of the three HRP cases, virtually all of the positive labeled perikarya were found in layers 3, 5, and 6. The proportion of labeled neurons located in the supra- and infragranular layers varied from region to region in a pattern that was consistent in all the cases. Thus, neurons that projected to TP from isocortical association areas (e.g., areas TA, TE, prefrontal cortex) were more heavily concentrated within supragranular layers whereas the projections from nonisocortical paralimbic areas (e.g., OFdg, entorhinal) tended to arise predominantly from deeper layers of cortex.&amp;quot; (p. 98)</Quotation>

Visual association input from inferotemporal cortex, was substantial (9%) only in case C with the ventral TP injection site, whereas this proportion was no more than 1% in the other two cases. Amygdaloid and olfactory input also showed consistent differences. Thus, 18% and 13% of all labeled cortical and amygdaloid neurons in cases C and B were located in the amygdala whereas this percentage fell to 5% in case A. Although labeled POC neurons never constituted more than 1% of the total retrograde labeling, they were more numerous in cases B and C.In each of the three HRP cases, virtually all of the positive labeled perikarya were found in layers 3, 5, and 6. The proportion of labeled neurons located in the supra- and infragranular layers varied from region to region in a pattern that was consistent in all the cases. Thus, neurons that projected to TP from isocortical association areas (e.g., areas TA, TE, prefrontal cortex) were more heavily concentrated within supragranular layers whereas the projections from nonisocortical paralimbic areas (e.g., OFdg, entorhinal) tended to arise predominantly from deeper layers of cortex.&amp;quot; (p. 98)</Quotation>

Although labeled POC neurons never constituted more than 1% of the total retrograde labeling, they were more numerous in cases B and C.In each of the three HRP cases, virtually all of the positive labeled perikarya were found in layers 3, 5, and 6. The proportion of labeled neurons located in the supra- and infragranular layers varied from region to region in a pattern that was consistent in all the cases. Thus, neurons that projected to TP from isocortical association areas (e.g., areas TA, TE, prefrontal cortex) were more heavily concentrated within supragranular layers whereas the projections from nonisocortical paralimbic areas (e.g., OFdg, entorhinal) tended to arise predominantly from deeper layers of cortex.&amp;quot; (p. 98)</Quotation>

<Quotation>&amp;quot;Cortical labeling was remarkably selective. Almost all labeled neurons were found in the anterior half of the temporal lobe, in orbitofrontal cortex, and in the medial frontal region (Figs. 3-5).&amp;quot; (p. 91)&amp;quot;The total numbers of labeled cortical (including POC and hippocampus) and amygdaloid neurons were quite comparable in cases A-C. These numbers were 3,443 in case A, 3,822 in case B, and 3,373 in case C. However, the distribution of theses neurons showed differences. For example, in case A, which had the dorsal HRP injection site, 33% of all retrogradely labeled neurons were situated in auditory association cortex of the superior temporal gyrus. This percentage was 6% and 13% for cases B and C, respectively. Visual association input from inferotemporal cortex, was substantial (9%) only in case C with the ventral TP injection site, whereas this proportion was no more than 1% in the other two cases. Amygdaloid and olfactory input also showed consistent differences. Thus, 18% and 13% of all labeled cortical and amygdaloid neurons in cases C and B were located in the amygdala whereas this percentage fell to 5% in case A. Although labeled POC neurons never constituted more than 1% of the total retrograde labeling, they were more numerous in cases B and C.In each of the three HRP cases, virtually all of the positive labeled perikarya were found in layers 3, 5, and 6. The proportion of labeled neurons located in the supra- and infragranular layers varied from region to region in a pattern that was consistent in all the cases. Thus, neurons that projected to TP from isocortical association areas (e.g., areas TA, TE, prefrontal cortex) were more heavily concentrated within supragranular layers whereas the projections from nonisocortical paralimbic areas (e.g., OFdg, entorhinal) tended to arise predominantly from deeper layers of cortex.&amp;quot; (p. 98)</Quotation>
